# easy-scripts
**Quick and dirty scripts for simple biology**

Collection of scripts aimed at introductory user-side bioinformatics for the layperson.
The goals of the script collection is as follows:

- Practical : The scripts need to be useful for a real task right out of the gate, not just demonstrate a principle.
- Well-annotated : It's not educational if you can't understand what it really does.
- Portable : The scripts should be usable on most systems with smallest number of dependencies. 

Eventually the growing body of QoL scripts will be compiled together into a single educational/research aid framework for amateur scientists.
